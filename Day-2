Generative AI or Gen AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate new content (images, text, videos, codes etc).
In previous era, we were solely focusing on classifications based on predictions.

Gen AI Tools:
ChatGPT                                                          Gemini
DeepSeek                                                         Dall e
Copilot                                                          Grok

•	ChatGPT:
 ChatGPT s a series of popular generative AI models developed and maintained by OpenAI.

•	DeepSeek:
Unlike traditional AI firms that operate on closed-source, high-cost models, DeepSeek follows a more open-source approach, providing developers and businesses access to cutting-edge AI without excessive price barriers.

•	Copilot:
a copilot refers to an AI assistant that helps users write code, documents, or perform tasks.

•	Gemini:
Gemini is also the name of Google’s AI model, designed to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.It helps in tasks like writing, coding, searching, and answering questions.

•	Dall e:
DALL·E (pronounced like "Dolly") is an artificial intelligence program that takes a text prompt and creates a matching realistic or artistic image.

•	Grok:
Grok is a free AI assistant designed by xAI to maximize truth and objectivity. Grok offers real-time search, image generation, trend analysis, and more.

Internet Architecture:
Input   Processor  Output

Generative AI Architecture:
Prompt  Model  Generated Content

AI Models:
Every AI Models are based on LLM. AI models are mathematical and computational frameworks designed to perform tasks such as classification, prediction, decision-making, or pattern recognition.
There are some models like:

•	GPT 3.5/GPT 4.0                                                        
•	Claude 3                                                                      
•	Whisper/Google Speech                                              
•	Gemini 1.5
•	LLaMA 3
•	Codex

LLM (Large Language Model):
LLM is a type of AI trained to understand and generate human like text. It uses vast database like books or websites to learn patterns language. 
Example: ChatGPT, Google.
Key Terms Commonly used:
•	Tokens
•	Parameter
•	Prompt
•	Fine-Tuning 
•	Inference

Applications:
•	CharBots:24/7 Customer Support
•	Education: Personalized Tutoring
•	Healthcare: Summarizing Records
•	Legal: Drafting Contracts
•	Writing: Blogs, Poetry, Code

Limitations:
•	Hallucination
•	Bias
•	No real understanding
•	Context length

Ethical concerns:
•	Misinformation generation
•	Data privacy
•	Deep fakes

Inside the LLM – Transformers 
Text data ----Tokenizer----Language Model-----output

*Self attention (model finds which word relate to each other )
*Feed Forward Network (learns deeper features)
*Positional Encoding ( remember word order)

Training LLMS(behind the scenes)
Pretraining : read tons of text -----predict the next word
Fine tuning : refine on specialized data 
RLHF(reinforcement learning with human feedback) : people keep it learn better responses .
Eg: Teaching a parrot basic words----later refining to speak in sentences.
